        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Joe Burgess! Back in 1988(or 1999 I cant remember...)
        in the 5th grade I sat down in front of this big box that was making strange noises
        and what I thought was a small tv. As teacher typed on the keyboard this Robin Hood
        game appeared on the screen(after like 2 minutes of loading!) and sound beeped
        from the tiny built in speaker. I was absolutely amazed! What is this strange box? 
        How does it work? Why is it making grinding noises? Whats inside of it? I was hooked! 
        Since that I have been I have learned(and still learning!) as much as I can about
        computers. From building my own PCs, to networking my house, to coding tools and 
        apps, to setting up home servers, to hacking, to hardware hacking, I love it all! 
        If its tech based I'm interested! The thing I love most about tech is the never ending 
        learning journey I am embarking on. A motto I have is "Always be learning".
        </p>

        <p>In my personal life I am a proud father of four amazing children! Time just fly's... They are all older now.
        Two of them out of the house. One married. Where did the time go? It seems like yesterday I was deep in diapers
        spit up! For my hobbies I am a avid SCUBA diver and lover of nature. One of my diving goals 
        I am slowly working on is to get cave certified. It requires a lot of training but its worth it!
        But yeah that's a bit about me! If you would like to know more about me hire me!!!
        I promise you wont be disappointed!</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Well I have nun chuck skills, bow staff skills. Wait... wrong skills!</p>

        <p>I have a wide range of technical skills that would be an asset to any company. I am well 
        versed in Linux and the command line, git, docker, python, shell, networking, and 
        finding information quickly. I also have personal qualities like a strong work ethic,
        integrity, care about my quality of work, positive attitude, caring, and loyal.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p><b>Eq-Virtools</b></p>
        <p>Eq-virtools is the current project I am working on. I play an old game 
        called Everquest. Best game ever made! I needed a way to track events in the
        game and alert me either visually or via voice notifications. This is when
        eq-virtools was born! The app parses the game log file looking for string patterns
        the user defines. When a string pattern is matched a trigger is fired.</p>

        <p><b>Features</b></p>
        <ul id="features">
          <li>Auto active toon detection</li>
          <li>Auto zone detection</li>
          <li>Voice Notifications</li>
          <li>Overlays</li>
          <li>Mob death timers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below is a screen shot of the Mob Respawn Timers. When a mob dies a timer
        is started. The timers can also be colored which is handy for place holders
        or other important mobs.</p>
