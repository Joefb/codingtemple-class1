        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <section id="about">
          <p>
            Hello my name is Joe Burgess! Back in 1988(or 1989 I cant
            remember...) in the 5th grade I sat down in front of this big box
            that was making strange noises and what I thought was a small tv. As
            teacher typed on the keyboard this Robin Hood game appeared on the
            screen(after like 2 minutes of loading!) and sound beeped from the
            tiny built in speaker. I was absolutely amazed! What is this strange
            box? How does it work? Why is it making grinding noises? Whats
            inside of it? I was hooked! Since that day so many years ago I have
            learned(and still learning!) as much as I can about computers. From
            building my own PCs, to networking my house, to coding tools and
            apps, to setting up home servers, to hacking, to hardware hacking, I
            love it all! If its tech based I'm interested! The thing I love most
            about tech is the never ending learning journey I am embarking on. A
            motto I have is "Always be learning".
          </p>

          <p>
            In my personal life I am a proud father of four amazing children!
            Time just fly's... They are all older now. Two of them out of the
            house. One married. Where did the time go? It seems like yesterday I
            was deep in diapers spit up! For my hobbies I am a avid SCUBA diver
            and lover of nature. One of my diving goals I am slowly working on
            is to get cave certified. It requires a lot of training but its
            worth it! But yeah that's a bit about me! If you would like to know
            more about me hire me!!! I promise you wont be disappointed!

          <p><b>eq-virtools</b></p>
          <p>
            eq-virtools is the current project I am working on. I play an old
            game called Everquest. Best game ever made! I needed a way to track
            events in the game and alert me either visually or via voice
            notifications. This is when eq-virtools was born! The app parses the
            game log file looking for string patterns the user defines. When a
            string pattern is matched a trigger is fired.
          </p>
          <p><b>Features</b></p>
          <ul id="features">
            <li>Auto active toon detection</li>
            <li>Auto zone detection</li>
            <li>Voice Notifications</li>
            <li>Overlays</li>
            <li>Mob death timers</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Below is a screen shot of the Mob Respawn Timers. When a mob dies a
            timer is started. The timers can also be colored which is handy for
            place holders or other important mobs. This is just one of the many
            features. Take a look on
